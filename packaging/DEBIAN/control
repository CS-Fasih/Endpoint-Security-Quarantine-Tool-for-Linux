Description: Sentinel — Real-Time Endpoint Security & Quarantine Tool
 Sentinel is a Linux endpoint security daemon that provides real-time
 file monitoring via inotify, ClamAV-based malware scanning, automatic
 quarantine with manifest tracking, and a polished Electron GUI for
 threat management.  The daemon communicates with the GUI over a
 permission-controlled UNIX domain socket.
 .
 Features:
  - Multi-threaded scan pipeline (pthread thread pool)
  - Recursive inotify file watcher with ENOSPC graceful fallback
  - ClamAV clamd integration for virus detection
  - Automatic quarantine with UUID-based manifest
  - Secure UNIX domain socket IPC (no TCP exposure)
  - Electron dashboard with real-time scan log and threat vault
  - State synchronisation: GUI rebuilds vault on reconnect
Depends: clamav (>= 0.103), clamav-daemon, libjson-c5, libpthread-stubs0-dev
